**Jasmine Prototype**

This is a brief prototype to demonstrate how to include Jasmine for front-end JavaScript unit testing.

A single JavaScript file containing functions to be tested is in the */public/js* directory.

The */tests* directory contains:
- the */lib* directory, which contains Jasmine source files  
- the */spec* directory, which contains the unit tests  
- the MIT.LICENSE file, which should always be included  
- the *SpecRunner.html* file, which will run the unit tests when opened in a web browser
